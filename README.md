# Train-Scheduler

## Summary
  - Use this app to schedule trains and save that schedule to a Firebase database. Then you are able to see all the scheduled trains. The app also calculates the "minutes to arrival" and "the next train time" which is based on how often the Trains come (frequency).
  
## Challenges
  - I had to use Bootstrap because I was having trouble styling the Table element. 
  - getting the minutes to arrival to work properly because of Javascript
